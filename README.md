A well-known spare parts company with a good reputation is looking to expand its business overseas but is facing machine breakdowns during production, resulting in increased costs that hinder expansion. To address this issue, we implemented a predictive maintenance model to anticipate machine damage, leading to significant cost savings through data science processes. These processes included data understanding, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, data preprocessing, modelling, and evaluation to extract insights and provide recommendations. With the XGBoost algorithm, we achieved a cost savings of 3.3 times, with insights highlighting rotational speed as a critical factor in machine failure and recommendations for maintenance schedules and high-quality parts suppliers.
